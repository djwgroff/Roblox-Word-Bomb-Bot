# Roblox Word Bomb Bot
A simple terminal-based bot for the Roblox game [Word Bomb](https://www.roblox.com/games/2653064683/Word-Bomb). 
This is just something I made for fun, you probably shouldn't use it in real games. [Word list source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ironicninja/bomb-party-dict).
